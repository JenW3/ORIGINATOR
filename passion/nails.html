 <h1>WELCOME 2 PNKNAILD IT</h1> 
 <p>I would like to introduce myself. I am Jen Warren better known as PNKNAILD IT., I am a nail ethusiast. I would not call myself a beginner nail tech as I have been studying nails and doing my own for 3 years now. I am still working on my craft to better my application of product. I have experience with polygel, soft gel,gelx and acyrilic. My preference is polygel. Creating nails sets is my artistic outlet. I am trying  to vlog my nail journey using TikTok as a place tp upload my nail content </p>  </p>
